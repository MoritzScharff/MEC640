Welcome to MEC640's documentation!
================================================

The Soft Robotics course tries to introduce the students to the world of Soft Robotics by discussing chosen cases from literature to show the variety of this field of research.
Therefore, the chosen papers are reviewed and discussed in detail, any possibly created source code will be documented on this website for later review, reuse etc. The source files are available at `GitHub <https://github.com/MoritzScharff/Soft-Robotics-Course>`_ .
